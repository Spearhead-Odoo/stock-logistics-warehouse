# Stock Warehouse

Extend the stock related models (warehouse, location, picking, move...) but without impact flows and processes. It's mainly adding fields or buttons.

Are you looking for modules related to logistics? Or would like to contribute
to? There are many repositories with specific purposes. Have a look at this
[README](https://github.com/OCA/wms/blob/18.0/README.md).
